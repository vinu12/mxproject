           <p>The Banking and Finance BA combines the study of modern economics with banking and finance. You will be introduced to a broad range of economic subjects including banking, financial intermediation, asset and liability management, financial decision making, financial markets and institutions, and accounting. This wide range of topics will give you an in-depth understanding of the way that organisations and financial systems work.</p>

		<p>You will also learn to apply microeconomic and macroeconomic theory in financial contexts, for example the appraisal of competing investment opportunities – how to choose between investments which offer the same financial returns – and how government policy influences the stock market.
