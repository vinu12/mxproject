​
<ul class="statuses" >
<li  style="list-style:block;">
Top employers like Google, Apple, IBM, Starbucks are moving away from degrees to skills. The right place to understand this change is the real workplace, not a classroom.</li>

<li>Our projects are set in a global context that prepares you for dealing with an international workplace and diversity issues.</li>

<li>You can also opt for a week of international workplace exposure in Australia, New Zealand, UK, Canada and Singapore. (This, however, will depend on a minimum number of global participants.)</li>

<li>This is a hybrid delivery model. With less than 2 % completion rates in online courses, we ensure that you are kept motivated and supported throughout your schedule.</li>

<li>If you are thinking of becoming an entrepreneur, no classroom training can match the real experience of working in the perfect environment.</li>

<li>You get the work referrals and testimonials from your workplace colleagues and mentors, which will help you in your SOPs in college admissions or in adding tremendous value to the next job application.</li>
